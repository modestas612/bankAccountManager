The goal of this mini project is to write a simple service which sole purpose is to manage bank account balance. This service can import and export bank statement for one or several bank accounts via CSV and calculate account balance for given date.

This service where developed using SpringBoot framework, Rest API and Maven. To develop html templates used thymeleaf and bootstrap.
